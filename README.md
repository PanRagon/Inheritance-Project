# Inheritance Project
 Simple Inheritance smart contract to allow funds be transferred to a beneficiary over a set amount of time, on a weekly basis.

 The current build has not been tested and should not be deployed in it's current state. Do so at your own risk.


 # TODO
 * Implement unit tests and deploy on Ropsten test network.
 * Allow contract owner to specify what time units he wants the contract to release funds in (days, months, years).
 * Allow for multiple beneficiary addresses with different percentages of total wealth to inherit.
